This causes the electron to easily break away from its own nucleus under the influence of photons from other atoms. A large number of such atoms close together easily lose their individual third electrons to form a sea of electrons swimming around from atom to atom. This sea of electrons reacts to any small electrical force (photons), generating a current of electrons—I am describing lithium metal conducting electricity. Hydrogen and helium atoms do not lose their electrons to other atoms. They are “insulators.”"

The private sector responded enthusiastically, and those responses indicated a strong desire by U.S. companies to attach a commercial module to the ISS that could meet the needs of NASA as well as those of private entrepreneurs."

He described vividly what was going on. That’s the kind of thing. Not just “This is glacier cracks,” you see — quite different. I mean, the ice had to be felt, as you saw the top of it. Then he would tell me, “How do you think we know that there were glaciers all over the world at a certain time?” See, after we would look at it, he would say things like that -– “How do you think anybody knows that there were glaciers in the past?” So I said maybe — I don’t know, I don’t remember exactly."

But he would describe anyway, in a vivid way, and then always with some kind of lesson about it like, “How do you think we ever find these things out?” And there, of course, was standing if front of me, the method.

He read the long words –- “the dinosaur” so and so “attains a length of so and so many feet and the head is so and so many feet,” six feet wide or something. He would always stop and say, “You know what that means, 50 feet high and 6 feet wide, or 20 feet high and 6 feet wide?” “It means, if the dinosaur’s standing in our front yard, and your bedroom window, you know, is on the second floor, you’d see out the window his head standing looking at you. That’s what 20 feet is, because the height of one story’s about 10 feet. Further. If he tries to put his head in the window, he just can’t quite make it, has to break the sides.” I give this illustration because he would translate everything, and I learned to translate everything, so it’s the same disease. When I read something, more or less, I always translate it as best I can into, what it really means, you see."
