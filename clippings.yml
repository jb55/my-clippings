This causes the electron to easily break away from its own nucleus under the influence of photons from other atoms. A large number of such atoms close together easily lose their individual third electrons to form a sea of electrons swimming around from atom to atom. This sea of electrons reacts to any small electrical force (photons), generating a current of electrons—I am describing lithium metal conducting electricity. Hydrogen and helium atoms do not lose their electrons to other atoms. They are “insulators.”"
